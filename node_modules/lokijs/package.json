  "readme": "# LokiJS\n\n## Overview\n\nLokiJS is a document oriented client side database written in javascript.\nIts purpose is to store javascript objects as documents in a nosql fashion and retrieve them with a similar mechanism.\nRuns in node and the browser.\nLokiJS is ideal for the following scenarios: \n\n1. where a lightweight in-memory db is ideal\n2. cross-platform mobile apps where you can leverage the power of javascript and avoid interacting with native databases\n3. data sets are not so large that it wouldn't be a problem loading the entire db from a server and synchronising at the end of the work session\n\nLokiJS has limited supports for indexing, transactions, couchdb-style views.\n\nIn a nodejs/node-webkit environment LokiJS also persists to disk whenever an insert, update or remove is performed.\n\nexample usage [here](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS/wiki)\n\n## Current state\n\nLokiJS is currently at an alpha stage, it is stable but not 100% feature complete.\nAs LokiJS is written in Javascript it can be run on any environment supporting javascript such as browsers, node.js/node-webkit, hybrid mobile apps (such as phonegap/cordova), or the jvm through engines such as rhino.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor browser environments you simply need the lokijs.js file contained in src/\n\nYou can use bower to install lokijs with `bower install lokijs`\n\nFor node environments you can install through `npm install lokijs`.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* Wider and more specific support for indexes such as unique, compound.\n* Replication across nodes.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor help / enquiries contact joe.minichino@gmail.com\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, Joe Minichino <joe.minichino@gmail.com>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
